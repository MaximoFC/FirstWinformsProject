# FirstWinformsProject
This is my first project in Windows Forms. I developed this program for an university subject (Computer Lab I). It's a tool that allows to make calcs for an event organization.

To run this program, you need Visual Studio Community with .NET Desktop Development workload instaled. 
STEPS:
1- Open Visual Studio
2- On the start window, select Clone a repository
3- Enter the repository location, and then select the Clone button.
